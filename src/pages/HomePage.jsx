// Exercise 2: Set It Up
// write a class component ok
// make it a div with a class name of HomePage ok
// import ImageUploaderForm and FeedList ok
// include them inside of Homepage ok
// export default the Homepage component! ok

// Exercise 3: Prop It Up
// Need to extract photos from data and then pass it into FeedList ok

// Exercise 5: Letâ€™s Get InFormation - BONUS
// In order to get Homepage render the photo url you have uploaded to ImageUploader form,
// you will need to create a function called handleAddPhoto that updates photos state by
// accepting a url and creating a new object in photos state of the homepage component.
// Then pass in that function as props to ImageUploaderForm
// and when the user submits, call that function with the user submitted url.
